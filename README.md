Implementing algorithms connecting finite automata and regular expressions.

## Description

FAREC (Finite Automata and Regular Expression Converter) is an educational tool
designed to demonstrate the algorithms used to convert between finite automata
and regular expressions.
                
FAREC allows you to create a finite automaton/regular expression and then
convert it into an equivalent regular expression/finite automaton. Each step of
the conversion process is shown.
                                
To convert finite automata into regular expressions, FAREC uses the State
Elimination with GNFAs algorithm. To convert regular expressions into finite
automata, FAREC uses the McNaughton–Yamada–Thompson algorithm (also known as
Thompson's construction algorithm).
